Introduction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The primary objective is to build models that accurately estimate house prices, which can be valuable for real estate professionals, homeowners, and prospective buyers.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure you have Python and necessary dependencies installed. You'll also need access to the dataset containing information about houses and their sale prices.

Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn
Ensure you have these libraries installed, preferably using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Installation
To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Start by preprocessing the dataset:
Load the dataset (train.csv and test.csv).
Perform initial analysis and handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables and handle feature scaling.
Train machine learning models:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train various regression models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluate model performance:
Assess the accuracy and performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
Cross-validate models to ensure generalization.
Predict house prices on the test dataset:
Apply trained models to predict house prices on the test dataset (test.csv).
Save the predictions to a file for submission.
File Descriptions
train.csv: Contains the training dataset with features and sale prices.
test.csv: Contains the test dataset for prediction.
House_Price_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
submission.csv: Output file containing predicted house prices for the test dataset.
Results
The project achieves [mention your results here, such as accuracy scores, mean absolute error, etc.].
